# Forest-Fires
Researchers have observed that land surface temperature anomalies could be the reason of lower moisture content of vegetations and could increase the possibility of fire.The objective for this paper is assess the relationship between land surface temperature(LST) anomalies and forest fire occurrence as well as further exploring related fire prediction factors.



# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS : 
Hovomoller plots to study the change in Temprature anaomaly behavior with latitude and longitdue across years and Spatial Mean plots.

Binary regression analysis on Fire incidents using Basis function

## SUMMARY

1.Fire count has increased with time. Firecount for 2018 and 2019 are alomost double the count for 2017.

2. There is a baseline shift in the Fire count from 2011. From 2001 to 2010 the line plot is almost flat. In 2011 the Fire count is the lowest.

3. Locations with fire split wr.to LST anomaly:  almost 1:1 for positive and negative anomalies.

4. Th positive and negative anomalies show a similar relation with fire count.

5.The data is not sufficient to confirm the relationship. We need more samples and predictors.

## Next steps

1. Take 2001 - 2010 as baseline model.

2. Study the Fire causes.Add them in the model as categorical variables.

3. Study the lower fire count in 2011.
4. Study vegetation and  precipitation data.
